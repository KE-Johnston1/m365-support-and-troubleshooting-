Support Guidance
This file contains practical notes that support decision making, escalation, and recognising common patterns in Microsoft 365 support. These habits and checks are used in real IT environments to keep support efficient and consistent.

How to Escalate an Issue
Escalation is a normal part of support work. It shows good judgement when used at the right time.

When to escalate
The issue
Cannot be reproduced
Requires permissions you do not have
Involves security or compliance
Affects multiple users
Is caused by a service outage
Has already been through standard troubleshooting
Needs specialist knowledge such as networking or advanced PowerShell

How to escalate professionally
Document what you have already tried
Include error messages
Add timestamps
Explain the impact on the user
State what you believe the next team should check
Notify the user that you are escalating
Hand over clearly and politely

Example message
“I have completed all standard troubleshooting steps and the issue appears to be related to a backend configuration. I am escalating this to the specialist team with full notes. I will keep you updated.”

Service Health Check
Before deep troubleshooting, always check whether the issue is caused by a Microsoft 365 service problem.

How to check
Open the Microsoft 365 Admin Centre
Select Service Health
Look for advisories or incidents
Check if the affected service matches the user’s issue

Why this matters
It prevents unnecessary troubleshooting
It confirms whether the issue is widespread
It helps you communicate clearly with users

What to tell the user
“There is a temporary service issue affecting Microsoft 365. The engineering team is working on it and I will update you as soon as the status changes.”

Licensing Quick Check
Licensing issues are one of the most common causes of Microsoft 365 problems.

What to check
Does the user have the correct licence
Has the licence recently changed
Has the licence expired
Does the licence include the required apps
Has the licence synced correctly

Common symptoms
Outlook not activating
Teams not loading
OneDrive not syncing
Missing apps in the Microsoft 365 portal
User cannot sign in even with correct credentials

Quick steps
Open Admin Centre
Search for the user
Check Assigned Licences
Toggle the licence off and on
Save changes
Ask the user to sign out and back in

Common User Mistakes
These are everyday issues that look like technical problems but are caused by simple user actions.

Outlook
Signed into the wrong account
Closed Outlook instead of minimising
Disabled Cached Mode without realising

OneDrive
Paused sync accidentally
Moved the OneDrive folder
Renamed a synced folder locally

Teams
Signed into a personal account
Muted microphone in Windows
Closed Teams instead of quitting it

Identity and MFA
Changed phone without re enrolling
Typed old password repeatedly
Has multiple accounts cached

Windows
Incorrect date and time
Connected to guest Wi‑Fi
Airplane mode enabled

Notes
These checks help rule out common causes quickly and keep support efficient.
They also show awareness of real user behaviour, which is a key part of IT Support.
