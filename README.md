Why I Built This Project
I created this project to build confidence with Microsoft 365 support and to show how I approach troubleshooting in a real IT environment.
As someone transitioning into IT, I wanted a practical way to demonstrate structured thinking, clear documentation, and the ability to guide users through issues in plain English.

This project reflects real service desk work and shows how I break down problems, investigate root causes, and communicate solutions.

What I Learned
Working through this project strengthened several key skills:

Understanding Microsoft 365 behaviour
Recognising common patterns in Outlook, OneDrive, Teams, and identity issues
Using Microsoft Graph PowerShell for real support tasks
Documenting troubleshooting steps clearly and professionally
Knowing when to escalate and how to communicate with users
Building a structured, readable knowledge base
Thinking like a technician rather than just following instructions

It also helped me build confidence in supporting users and explaining technical issues simply.

Next Steps
I plan to continue improving this project by:

Adding more advanced troubleshooting scenarios
Expanding the PowerShell section
Creating short video walkthroughs for common fixes
Adding more user facing guides
Building a small lab environment to test additional Microsoft 365 behaviours

This project will grow as I gain more hands‑on experience.

What This Project Demonstrates
Clear troubleshooting logic
Professional documentation
Understanding of Microsoft 365 services
User empathy and communication skills
Awareness of identity and MFA workflows
Basic PowerShell capability
Structured thinking and escalation judgement

It reflects the practical work expected in IT Support roles.

Who This Project Is For
People transitioning into IT Support
Junior technicians building confidence
Anyone preparing for helpdesk or service desk roles
Learners studying for CompTIA A+, Network+, or Microsoft 365 fundamentals

Final Notes
This project is intentionally written in clear, human language.
It avoids jargon, over engineering, and unnecessary complexity.
The aim is to show practical, real world troubleshooting the kind of work that happens every day in IT Support.

If you are learning, transitioning careers, or preparing for interviews, this repository gives you a strong, confident foundation to build on.
