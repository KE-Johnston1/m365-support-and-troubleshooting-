Growth Mindset Reflection
When I started learning Microsoft 365 support, I often felt unsure about where issues were coming from. Identity, licensing, local apps, cloud services, Conditional Access, MFA — it can feel like a lot at first. Building this project helped me slow down, check the basics, and recognise the patterns behind common problems.

Working through each scenario taught me to stay calm, think step by step, and communicate clearly with users. It also helped me build confidence in my ability to troubleshoot real issues rather than just follow instructions. This project reflects my growth as a technician and my commitment to improving every day.

Final Notes
This project is written in clear, human language and focuses on practical, real world troubleshooting. It reflects the type of work handled daily in IT Support and shows how I approach problems, communicate with users, and continue to grow my skills.
